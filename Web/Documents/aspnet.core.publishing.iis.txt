The 'VFPOLEDB.1' provider is not registered on the local machine”  :https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15684575/getting-the-error-the-vfpoledb-1-provider-is-not-registered-on-the-local-mach

It is registered as it should. It is your application that is compiled for AnyCPU Platform.
In x64 operating system this produces 64bit code and 64bit code could not access 32bit drivers.

Change your Platform to x86 and you will be fine.
